# ECMA-402 Style Guide

This document is an evolving list of recommendations for the ECMA-402 specification.  Other specifications may refer to this document if desired.  Also see the [W3C TAG Design Principles](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#casing-rules) for additional guidance.

This document contains background on how the style decisions were reached.  The actual recommendations are highlighted with a :star2: emoji.

## Casing Conventions

This section concerns the casing conventions for identifiers and string literals in ECMA-402.

There are several accepted conventions for the casing of identifiers in programming.  This document uses the following definitions:

- **Pascal case:** First letter of each tokens in the identifer is uppercase, and all other letters are lowercase. Example: `HelloWorld`
- **Camel case:** Like Pascal case, except that the first letter of the identifier is lowercase. Example: `helloWorld`
- **Kebab case:** All letters are lowercase, and an ASCII hyphen `-` separates tokens. Example: `hello-world`

### Identifiers defined by ECMA-402

:star2: *Use Pascal case for class names and global namespaces; use camel case for all other identifiers.* :star2:

#### Examples

The function names, object keys, and string enumeration values below are all in camel case.

```javascript
new Intl.DisplayNames(undefined, {
    type: "dateTimeField"
}).of("timeZoneName");

number.toLocaleString(undefined, {
    signDisplay: "exceptZero"
});
```

#### Alternative: Kebab case for all string enumerations

We could more closely follow the W3C TAG recommendation, which uses kebab case for string enumeration values.  This would result in something such as:

```javascript
new Intl.DisplayNames(undefined, {
    type: "date-time-field"
}).of("time-zone-name");

number.toLocaleString(undefined, {
    signDisplay: "except-zero"
});
```

##### Pros

- More consistent with web conventions outside of ECMA-402; follows programmer intuition.
- More consistent with the local identifier syntax discussed below.
- ECMA-262 has limited precedent, but there are examples of kebab case, such as [the return value of *Atomics.wait*](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-atomics.wait), a string enumeration that is `"ok"`, `"not-equal"`, or `"timed-out"`.

##### Cons

- Some string enumerations can be use not only as a string but also as a key in an object literal.  It is desirable to use the same identifier in both places.  For example, the identifier `"timeZoneName"` below:

```javascript
new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", {
  timeZoneName: "short"
}).formatToParts(0);

/*
0: {type: "month", value: "12"}
1: {type: "literal", value: "/"}
2: {type: "day", value: "31"}
3: {type: "literal", value: "/"}
4: {type: "year", value: "1969"}
5: {type: "literal", value: ", "}
6: {type: "timeZoneName", value: "PST"}
*/
```

- String identifiers can appear in both the input and the output of an API, so we can't restrict camel case only to API output.  For example, `"timeZoneName"` also appears in this context:

```javascript
new Intl.DisplayNames(undefined, {
    type: "dateTimeField"
}).of("timeZoneName");
```

##### Decision

- The ergonomics of using the same identifier in multiple contexts outweights the desire to match the W3C convention.
- We believe that most users will typically copy these strings off MDN, rather than typing them manually, weakening the importance of following programmer intuition.

#### Alternative: Kebab case for new identifiers only

A way to be closer to the W3C recommendation would be to use kebab case except when there's precedent for camel case in the identifier.  So, for `"timeZoneName"`, we would use camel case, but for a new identifier like `"except-zero"`, we would use kebab case.  Example:

```javascript
new Intl.DisplayNames(undefined, {
    type: "date-time-field"
}).of("timeZoneName");

number.toLocaleString(undefined, {
    signDisplay: "except-zero"
});
```

##### Pros

- Identifiers that are used in multiple contexts are consistent in the API across input, output, and keys.
- Most identifiers follow programmer intuition; those that don't are the exception rather than the rule.

##### Cons

- Could introduce problems if a string is introduced as kebab case now and then in the future wants to be used as the key of an object literal.
- Can introduce inconsistencies even in the same line of code, as shown in the example above.

##### Decision

- This hybrid approach creates more problems while not fully addressing the concerns of the kebab-case-only approach.

#### Alternative: Use kebab case but also accept camel case

ECMA-402 could allow users to choose between kebab case and camel case for relevant identifiers.  For example, when calling `Intl.DisplayNames.prototype.of`, the identifier could be either `"timeZoneName"` or `"time-zone-name"` and both would be treated equally.

##### Pros

- When writing code, programmers can follow their intuition.
- We still allow programmers to use the same identifiers in multiple contexts.

##### Cons

- Output strings (those generated by library functions rather than written in user code) cannot have multiple cases; this alternative does not clarify how to handle such strings.
- Could sow confusion as a result of multiple ways to achieve the same result.

##### Decision

- It is difficult to take this option seriously since it would add debt to the specification.
- If strongly desired, the spec could be changed later to allow the kebab-cased strings.

### Identifiers defined outside ECMA-402

:star2: *ECMA-402 sits between ECMA-262 and internationalization standards such as UTS #35. For identifiers whose syntax comes from a different specification, follow the convention in that specification.* :star2:

#### Examples

[BCP47](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) identifiers, using registered extensions as described in [UTS#35ยง3](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Identifiers).  Examples:

- `"en-US"`
- `"ar-EG-u-nu-latn"`

Unit identifiers, defined in [UTS #35 Part 2 Section 6](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-general.html#Unit_Elements).  Examples:

- `"square-kilometer"`
- `"part-per-million"`

#### Alternative: Convert identifiers to camel case

We could enforce a camel case convention on these strings, such as the following:

- `"enUs"`
- `"arEgUNuLatn"`
- `"squareKilometer"`
- `"partPerMillion"`

##### Pros

- More consistent with the recommendation for identifiers defined in ECMA-402.
- The identifiers could be used as keys in an object literal.
- Users typing these strings don't care that the syntax came from someone else's spec.

##### Cons

- If the strings come from an external source, they might have to be converted to camel case before use.
- Loss of the ability to use different cases within the identifier, like `"US"` in `"en-US"`.
- More difficult to read in cases where there are many short tokens, such as in locale identifiers.

##### Decision

- Defer the decision on the syntax for identifiers to the other specification when possible.
