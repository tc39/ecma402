  <p>
    The ECMAScript 2020 Internationalization API Specification (ECMA-402 6<sup>th</sup> Edition), provides key language sensitive functionality as a complement to the ECMAScript 2020 Language Specification (ECMA-262 10<sup>th</sup> Edition or successor). Its functionality has been selected from that of well-established internationalization APIs such as those of the Internationalization Components for Unicode (ICU) library, of the .NET framework, or of the Java platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 1<sup>st</sup> Edition API was developed by an ad-hoc group established by Ecma TC39 in September 2010 based on a proposal by Nebojša Ćirić and Jungshik Shin.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition API was adopted by the General Assembly of June 2015, as a complement to the ECMAScript 6th Edition.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition API was the first edition released under Ecma TC39's new yearly release cadence and open development process. A plain-text source document was built from the ECMA-402 source document to serve as the base for further development entirely on GitHub. Over the year of this standard's development, dozens of pull requests and issues were filed representing several of bug fixes, editorial fixes and other improvements. Additionally, numerous software tools were developed to aid in this effort including Ecmarkup, Ecmarkdown, and Grammarkdown.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dozens of individuals representing many organizations have made very significant contributions within Ecma TC39 to the development of this edition and to the prior editions. In addition, a vibrant community has emerged supporting TC39's ECMAScript efforts. This community has reviewed numerous drafts, filed dozens of bug reports, performed implementation experiments, contributed test suites, and educated the world-wide developer community about ECMAScript Internationalization. Unfortunately, it is impossible to identify and acknowledge every person and organization who has contributed to this effort.
