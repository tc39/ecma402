    <h1>Internationalization, Localization, and Globalization</h1>

    <p>Internationalization of software means designing it such that it supports or can be easily adapted to support the needs of users speaking different languages and having different cultural expectations, and enables worldwide communication between them. Localization then is the actual adaptation to a specific language and culture. Globalization of software is commonly understood to be the combination of internationalization and localization. Globalization starts at the lowest level by using a text representation that supports all languages in the world, and using standard identifiers to identify languages, countries, time zones, and other relevant parameters. It continues with using a user interface language and data presentation that the user understands, and finally often requires product-specific adaptations to the user's language, culture, and environment.</p>
    <p>ECMA-262 lays the foundation by using Unicode for text representation and by providing a few language-sensitive functions, but gives applications little control over the behaviour of these functions. This specification builds on that foundation by providing a set of customizable language-sensitive functionality. The API is useful even for applications that themselves are not internationalized, as even applications targeting only one language and one region need to properly support that one language and region. However, the API also enables applications that support multiple languages and regions, even concurrently, as may be needed in server environments.</p>
  </emu-clause>

  <emu-clause id="sec-api-overview">
    <h1>API Overview</h1>

    <p>This specification is designed to complement ECMA-262 by providing key language-sensitive functionality, and can be added to an implementation thereof in whole or in part. This specification introduces new language values observable to ECMAScript code (such as the value of a [[FallbackSymbol]] internal slot and the set of values transitively reachable from %Intl% by <emu-xref href="#sec-property-accessors">property access</emu-xref>), and also refines the definition of some functions specified in ECMA-262 (as described below). Neither category prohibits behaviour that is otherwise permitted for values and interfaces defined in ECMA-262, in order to support adoption of this specification by any implementation.</p>
    <p>This specification provides several key pieces of language-sensitive functionality that are required in most applications: locale selection and inspection, string comparison (collation) and case conversion, pluralization rules, text segmentation, and formatting of numbers, absolute and relative dates and times, durations, and lists. While ECMA-262 provides functions for this basic functionality (on <emu-xref href="#sec-array.prototype">Array.prototype</emu-xref>: `toLocaleString`; on <emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype">String.prototype</emu-xref>: `localeCompare`, `toLocaleLowerCase`, `toLocaleUpperCase`; on <emu-xref href="#sec-number.prototype">Number.prototype</emu-xref>: `toLocaleString`; on <emu-xref href="#sec-date.prototype">Date.prototype</emu-xref>: `toLocaleString`, `toLocaleDateString`, and `toLocaleTimeString`), their actual behaviour is left largely implemenation-defined. This specification provides additional functionality, control over the language and over details of the behaviour to be used, and a more complete specification of required functionality.</p>

    <p>Applications can use the API in two ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Directly, by using a service constructor to construct an object, specifying a list of preferred languages and options to configure its behaviour. The object provides a main function (`compare`, `select`, `format`, etc.), which can be called repeatedly. It also provides a `resolvedOptions` function, which the application can use to find out the exact configuration of the object.
      </li>
      <li>
        Indirectly, by using the functions of ECMA-262 mentioned above. The collation and formatting functions are respecified in this specification to accept the same arguments as the Collator, NumberFormat, and DateTimeFormat constructors and produce the same results as their compare or format methods. The case conversion functions are respecified to accept a list of preferred languages.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The Intl object is used to package all functionality defined in this specification in order to avoid name collisions.</p>

    <emu-note>While the API includes a variety of formatters, it does not provide any parsing facilities. This is intentional, has been discussed extensively, and concluded after weighing in all the benefits and drawbacks of including said functionality. See the discussion on the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/424">issue tracker</a>.</emu-note>

  <emu-clause id="sec-api-conventions">
    <h1>API Conventions</h1>

    <p>Every <emu-xref href="#sec-constructor-properties-of-the-intl-object">Intl constructor</emu-xref> should behave as if defined by a class, throwing a *TypeError* exception when called as a function (without NewTarget). For backwards compatibility with past editions, this does not apply to %Intl.Collator%, %Intl.DateTimeFormat%, or %Intl.NumberFormat%, each of which construct and return a new object when called as a function.</p>

    <emu-note id="legacy-constructor">
      In ECMA 402 v1, Intl constructors supported a mode of operation where calling them with an existing object as a receiver would add relevant internal slots to the receiver, effectively transforming it into an instance of the class. In ECMA 402 v2, this capability was removed, to avoid adding internal slots to existing objects. In ECMA 402 v3, the capability was re-added as "normative optional" in a mode which chains the underlying Intl instance on any object, when the constructor is called. See <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/57">Issue 57</a> for details.

  <emu-clause id="sec-implementation-dependencies">
    <h1>Implementation Dependencies</h1>

    <p>Due to the nature of internationalization, this specification has to leave several details implementation dependent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>The set of locales that an implementation supports with adequate localizations:</em> Linguists have described thousands of human languages, with the IANA Language Subtag Registry containing over 7000 primary language subtags (used as the base for locale identifiers). Even large locale data collections, such as the Common Locale Data Repository, cover only a tiny subset of all languages and their regional or dialectical variations. Implementations targeting resource-constrained devices may have to further reduce the subset.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>The exact form of localizations such as format patterns:</em> In many cases locale-dependent conventions are not standardized, so different forms may exist side by side, or they vary over time. Different internationalization libraries may have implemented different forms, without any of them being actually wrong. In order to allow this API to be implemented on top of existing libraries, such variations have to be permitted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Subsets of Unicode:</em> Some operations, such as collation, operate on strings that can include characters from the entire Unicode character set. However, both the Unicode Standard and the ECMAScript standard allow implementations to limit their functionality to subsets of the Unicode character set. In addition, locale conventions typically don't specify the desired behaviour for the entire Unicode character set, but only for those characters that are relevant for the locale. While the Unicode Collation Algorithm combines a default collation order for the entire Unicode character set with the ability to tailor for local conventions, subsets and tailorings still result in differences in behaviour.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In browser implementations the initial set of locales, currencies, calendars, numbering systems, and other enumerable items visible to a particular origin must be the same for all users sharing the same user agent string (engine and platform version). Furthermore, dynamic changes to these sets must not result in users becoming distinguishable from each other. This constraint is imposed to reduce the fingerprinting risk inherent in internationalization, and may be relaxed in future revisions. As a result of this constraint, the first time a browser implementation that allows on-demand locale installation receives a request from a particular origin that could require installing a new locale, it must not reveal whether or not that locale is already installed.
    </p>

    <p>Throughout this specification, implementation- and locale-dependent behaviour is referred to as <dfn>ILD</dfn>, and implementation-, locale-, and numbering system-dependent behaviour is referred to as <dfn>ILND</dfn>.</p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-compatibility">
      <h1>Compatibility across implementations</h1>

      <p>
        ECMA 402 describes the schema of the data used by its functions. The
        data contained inside is implementation-dependent, and expected to
        change over time and vary between implementations. The variation is
        visible by programmers, and it is possible to construct programs which
        will depend on a particular output. However, this specification
        attempts to describe reasonable constraints which will allow
        well-written programs to function across implementations.
        Implementations are encouraged to continue their efforts to harmonize
        linguistic data.
