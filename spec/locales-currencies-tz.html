      Each such identifier can also be referred to as a <dfn variants="language tags">language tag</dfn>, and is in fact a valid language tag as that term is used in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt">BCP 47</a>.
      A locale identifier in canonical form as specified in <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Canonical_Unicode_Locale_Identifiers">Unicode Technical Standard #35 Part 1 Core, Section 3.2.1 Canonical Unicode Locale Identifiers</a> is referred to as a "<dfn variants="Unicode canonicalized locale identifiers">Unicode canonicalized locale identifier</dfn>".
    </p>

    <p>
      Locale identifiers consist of case-insensitive Unicode Basic Latin alphanumeric <dfn id="bcp-47-subtag" variants="subtag">subtags</dfn> separated by *"-"* (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS) characters, with single-character <emu-not-ref>subtags</emu-not-ref> referred to as "<dfn variants="singleton subtag">singleton subtags</dfn>".
      <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#u_Extension">Unicode Technical Standard #35 Part 1 Core, Section 3.6 Unicode BCP 47 U Extension</a> subtag sequences are used extensively, and the term "<dfn id="unicode-locale-extension-sequence" oldids="sec-unicode-locale-extension-sequences" variants="Unicode locale extension sequences">Unicode locale extension sequence</dfn>" describes the longest <emu-not-ref>substring</emu-not-ref> of a language tag that can be matched by the <code>unicode_locale_extensions</code> Unicode locale nonterminal and is not part of a *"-x-…"* private use <emu-not-ref>subtag sequence</emu-not-ref>. It starts with *"-u-"* and includes all immediately following <emu-not-ref>subtags</emu-not-ref> that are not singleton subtags, along with their preceding *"-"* separators. For example, the <emu-not-ref>Unicode locale extension sequence</emu-not-ref> of *"en-US-u-fw-mon-x-u-ex-foobar"* is *"-u-fw-mon"*.
    </p>

    <p>All structurally valid language tags are appropriate for use with the APIs defined by this specification, but implementations are not required to use Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (<a href="https://cldr.unicode.org">CLDR</a>) data for validating them; the set of locales and thus language tags that an implementation supports with adequate localizations is implementation-defined. <emu-xref href="#sec-constructor-properties-of-the-intl-object">Intl constructors</emu-xref> map requested language tags to locales supported by their respective implementations.</p>

  <emu-clause id="sec-use-of-iana-time-zone-database" oldids="sec-time-zone-names">
    <h1>Use of the IANA Time Zone Database</h1>

    <p>
      Implementations that adopt this specification must be time zone aware: they must use the IANA Time Zone Database <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones/">https://www.iana.org/time-zones/</a> to supply available named time zone identifiers and data used in ECMAScript calculations and formatting.
      This section defines how the IANA Time Zone Database should be used by time zone aware implementations.
      No String may be an available named time zone identifier unless it is a Zone name or a Link name in the IANA Time Zone Database.
      Available named time zone identifiers returned by ECMAScript built-in objects must use the casing found in the IANA Time Zone Database.
    </p>
    <p>Each Zone in the IANA Time Zone Database must be a primary time zone identifier and each Link name in the IANA Time Zone Database must be a non-primary time zone identifier that resolves to its corresponding Zone name, with the following exceptions implemented in AvailableNamedTimeZoneIdentifiers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For historical reasons, *"UTC"* must be a primary time zone identifier.
        *"Etc/UTC"*, *"Etc/GMT"*, and *"GMT"*, as well as all Link names that resolve to any of them, must be non-primary time identifiers that resolve to *"UTC"*.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any Link name that is present in the “TZ” column of file <code>zone.tab</code> must be a primary time zone identifier.
        For example, both *"Europe/Prague"* and *"Europe/Bratislava"* must be primary time zone identifiers.
        This requirement guarantees at least one primary time zone identifier for each <a href="https://www.iso.org/glossary-for-iso-3166.html">ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2</a> country code, and ensures that future changes to time zone rules of one country will not affect ECMAScript programs that use another country's time zone(s), unless those countries' territorial boundaries have also changed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any Link name that is not listed in the “TZ” column of file <code>zone.tab</code> and that represents a geographical area entirely contained within the territory of a single <a href="https://www.iso.org/glossary-for-iso-3166.html">ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2</a> country code must resolve to a primary identifier that also represents a geographical area entirely contained within the territory of the same country code.
        For example, *"Atlantic/Jan_Mayen"* must resolve to *"Arctic/Longyearbyen"*.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <emu-note>
      <p>
        The IANA Time Zone Database offers build options that affect which available named time zone identifiers are primary.
        The default build options merge different countries' time zones, for example *"Atlantic/Reykjavik"* is built as a Link to the Zone *"Africa/Abidjan"*.
        Geographically and politically distinct locations are likely to introduce divergent time zone rules in a future version of the IANA Time Zone Database.
        The exceptions above serve to mitigate these future-compatibility issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (<a href="https://cldr.unicode.org">CLDR</a>) implements most of the exceptions above when determining which available named time zone identifiers are primary or non-primary.
        Although use of CLDR data is recommended for consistency between implementations, it is not required.
        Non-CLDR-based implementations can still use CLDR's identifier data in <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/bcp47/timezone.xml"><code>timezone.xml</code></a>.
        Implementations may also build the IANA Time Zone Database directly, for example by using build options such as <code>PACKRATDATA=backzone PACKRATLIST=zone.tab</code> and performing any post-processing needed to ensure compliance with the requirements above.
      </p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>
      The IANA Time Zone Database is typically updated between five and ten times per year.
      These updates may add new Zone or Link names, may change Zones to Links, and may change the UTC offsets and transitions associated with any Zone.
      Implementations are recommended to include updates to the IANA Time Zone Database as soon as possible.
      Such prompt action ensures that ECMAScript programs can accurately perform time-zone-sensitive calculations and can use newly-added available named time zone identifiers supplied by external input or the host environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the IANA Time Zone Database maintainers strive for stability, in rare cases (averaging less than once per year) a Zone may be replaced by a new Zone.
      For example, in 2022 "*Europe/Kiev*" was deprecated to a Link resolving to a new "*Europe/Kyiv*" Zone.
      The deprecated Link is called a <dfn variants="renamed time zone identifiers">renamed time zone identifier</dfn> and the newly-added Zone is called a <dfn variants="replacement time zone identifiers">replacement time zone identifier</dfn>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reduce disruption from these infrequent changes, implementations should initially add each replacement time zone identifier as a non-primary time zone identifier that resolves to the existing renamed time zone identifier.
      This allows ECMAScript programs to recognize both identifiers, but also reduces the chance that an ECMAScript program will send the replacement time zone identifier to another system that does not yet recognize it.
      After a <dfn id="rename-waiting-period">rename waiting period</dfn>, implementations should promote the new Zone to a primary time zone identifier while simultaneously demoting the renamed time zone identifier to non-primary.
      To provide ample time for other systems to be updated, the recommended rename waiting period is two years.
      However, it does not need to be either exact or dynamic.
      Instead, implementations should make the replacement time zone identifier primary after the waiting period as part of their normal release process for updating time zone data.
    </p>
    <p>
      A waiting period should only apply when a new Zone is added to replace an existing Zone.
      If an existing Zone and Link are swapped, then no renaming has happened and no waiting period is necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      If implementations revise time zone information during the lifetime of an agent, then it is required that the list of available named time zone identifiers, the primary time zone identifier associated with any available named time zone identifier, and the UTC offsets and transitions associated with any available named time zone identifier, be consistent with results previously observed by that agent.
      Due to the complexity of supporting this requirement, it is recommended that implementations maintain a fully consistent copy of the IANA Time Zone Database for the lifetime of each agent.

        <p>The algorithm above for resolving Links to primary time zone identifiers is intended to correspond to the behaviour of <code>icu::TimeZone::getIanaID()</code> in the International Components for Unicode (<a href="https://icu.unicode.org/">ICU</a>) and the processes for maintaining time zone identifier data in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (<a href="https://cldr.unicode.org">CLDR</a>).</p>
        <p>
          This algorithm resolves Links to primary time zone identifiers without crossing the boundaries of ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 country codes, using data from files <code>zone.tab</code> and <code>backzone</code> of the IANA Time Zone Database.
          If the country code of a Link has only one line in <code>zone.tab</code>, then that line will determine the primary time zone identifier.
          However, if that country code has multiple lines in <code>zone.tab</code>, then historical mappings in <code>backzone</code> must be used to identify the correct primary time zone identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, to resolve "Pacific/Truk" (in country code "FM") if the default build options of the IANA Time Zone Database identify it as a Link to "Pacific/Port_Moresby" (in country code "PG"), then the “country-code” column of <code>zone.tab</code> must be checked for lines corresponding with "FM".
          If there were only one such line, then the “TZ” column of that line would determine the primary time zone identifier associated with "Pacific/Truk".
          But if there are multiple "FM" lines in <code>zone.tab</code>, then <code>backzone</code> must be inspected and a line such as "Link Pacific/Chuuk Pacific/Truk" would result in using "Pacific/Chuuk" as the primary time zone identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <code>zone.tab</code> is the preferred source of mapping data because <code>backzone</code> mappings may, in rare cases, cross the boundaries of ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 country codes.
          For example, "Atlantic/Jan_Mayen" (in country code "SJ") is mapped in <code>backzone</code> to "Europe/Oslo" (in country code "NO").
          As of the 2024a release of the IANA Time Zone Database, "Atlantic/Jan_Mayen" is the only case where this happens.
        </p>

      <emu-note>
        Time zone identifiers in the IANA Time Zone Database can change over time.
        At a minimum, it is recommended that implementations limit changes to the result of AvailableNamedTimeZoneIdentifiers to the changes allowed by GetAvailableNamedTimeZoneIdentifier, for the lifetime of the surrounding agent.
        Due to the complexity of supporting these recommendations, it is recommended that the result of AvailableNamedTimeZoneIdentifiers remains the same for the lifetime of the surrounding agent.

      <emu-note>
        For any _timeZoneIdentifier_, or any value that is an ASCII-case-insensitive match for it, it is required that the resulting Time Zone Identifier Record contain the same field values for the lifetime of the surrounding agent.
        Furthermore, it is required that time zone identifiers not dynamically change from primary to non-primary during the lifetime of the surrounding agent, meaning that if _timeZoneIdentifier_ is an ASCII-case-insensitive match for the [[PrimaryIdentifier]] field of the result of a previous call to GetAvailableNamedTimeZoneIdentifier, then GetAvailableNamedTimeZoneIdentifier(_timeZoneIdentifier_) must return a Time Zone Identifier Record where [[Identifier]] is [[PrimaryIdentifier]].
        Due to the complexity of supporting these requirements, it is recommended that the result of AvailableNamedTimeZoneIdentifiers (and therefore GetAvailableNamedTimeZoneIdentifier too) remains the same for the lifetime of the surrounding agent.
