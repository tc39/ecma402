  <p>This specification is authored on <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma402">GitHub</a> in a plaintext source format called <a href="https://github.com/bterlson/ecmarkup">Ecmarkup</a>. Ecmarkup is an HTML and Markdown dialect that provides a framework and toolset for authoring ECMAScript specifications in plaintext and processing the specification into a full-featured HTML rendering that follows the editorial conventions for this document. Ecmarkup builds on and integrates a number of other formats and technologies including <a href="https://github.com/rbuckton/grammarkdown">Grammarkdown</a> for defining syntax and <a href="https://github.com/domenic/ecmarkdown">Ecmarkdown</a> for authoring algorithm steps. PDF renderings of this specification are produced by printing the HTML rendering to a PDF.</p>
  <p>Prior editions of this specification were authored using Word&mdash;the Ecmarkup source text that formed the basis of this edition was produced by converting the ECMAScript 2015 Word document to Ecmarkup using an automated conversion tool.</p>
