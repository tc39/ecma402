# Contributing to ECMA-402

Thank you for your interest in improving ECMA-402, the ECMAScript's solution for internationalization.

## Ways to Contribute

### Bug Reports & Bug Fixes

File a bug or pull requests against the current text of ECMA402 in this repository. For more information, see [ecma262 CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues-and-pull-requests).

If the fix is trivial you may not need to sign the CLA. If your fix is involved, signing the CLA will be required. See the "Patent Policy and CLA" section below.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests for future versions of ECMA402 should be made in this repository by creating a new issue. Your goal will be to convince others that your proposal is a useful addition to the language and recruit TC39 members to help turn your request into a proposal and shepherd it into the language.

### Proposals

We follow the TC39 staging process for proposals.  See [ecma262 CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#new-feature-proposals) for more information and steps to get started.

## Patent Policy and CLA

There are a number of ways to contribute to ECMA-402. How to actually contribute depends on what you want to accomplish. In many cases, you may be required to execute a CLA with Ecma. See the final section named *Signing the CLA* for more information on this.

Ecma TC39 accepts contributions from non-member individuals who have accepted the TC39 copyright and patent policies. Currently all ECMAScript related technical work is done by the TC39 RF TG (Royalty Free Task Group), for which the following IPR Policies apply:

  * [Ecma International RF Patent Policy](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/Policies/Ecma_Royalty-Free_Patent_Policy_Extension_Option.htm)
  * [Ecma International Software Copyright Policy](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/Policies/Ecma_Policy_on_Submission_Inclusion_and_Licensing_of_Software.htm) ([PDF](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/Policies/Ecma_Policy_on_Submission_Inclusion_and_Licensing_of_Software.pdf))

### Signing the CLA

If you wish to submit a proposal and are not a representative of a TC39 member, here are the steps you need to take:

  1. Read the [TC39 process document](https://tc39.es/process-document/).
  2. [Register as a TC39 contributor](https://tc39.es/agreements/contributor/) (it is not necessary to submit the contribution as attachment to the form)
  3. Submit a pull request here for your strawman proposal.
