1. Questions/issues with existing advanced proposals and APIs
    1. [Normative: Add calendar and numberingSystem options](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/175)
        - Should we do validation which throws for these? Is there an ICU API?
    1. [Segmenter: Should we add all the options (lw, ss), or just lb?](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter/issues/23)
        - At the last meeting, it seemed like Steven favorited this change but Jungshik was hesitant
        - tiebreaker: stay minimal?
    1. Locale:
        1. [Consider performing complete Unicode extension canonicalization per RFC6067](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/issues/14)
            - Namely, should we sort and deduplicate all of the extensions (not just the recognized ones)?
        1. [Return DefaultLocale() when calling Intl.Locale() with an absent/undefined tag argument?](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/issues/15)
        1. [Spec questions/errors](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/issues/12)
            - Do we want to carry forward the optionality of kf and kn?
            - How are we handling regular and irregular grandfathered tags? (also for the [main specification](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/177))
anba's questions
1. ICU tickets to support existing advanced proposals and APIs
    1. [Add RelativeDateTimeFormatter.format(FieldPositionIterator)?](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13256)
        - Dan sent an icu-design email; does anyone want to review?
        - ICU patch wanted
    1. [RelativeDateTimeFormatter doesn't handle -0 well](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-12936)
        - ICU patch wanted
    1. [TimeZone::getOffset() : add two params to control repeated/skipped wall time](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13268)
        - Jungshik wrote a patch, anyone want to review?
        - Was a proposal sent to icu-design? (Dan can't find it)
    1. [Get locales with PluralRules support](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-12756)
        - Should we close as will-not-fix because all locales will always be considered supported?
    1. Any other support needed from ICU for Intl proposals?
1. New proposals
    1. [NumberFormat changes](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/215), including (a) restructuring the spec, (b) minor changes to behavior, (c) support for measure units, and (d) support for scientific and compact notation.
        - Overall thoughts?
        - What to do with the `style` option: "deprecate" it (Option 1) or keep it as a first-class citizen (Option 2)?
        - Where to put the modifiers for units, like the width and compound units: as a top-level setting (Option A) or as a nested object literal on the `unit` key (Option B)?
    1. [UnitFormat](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-unit-format) ([bug](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/32)) (Stage 1)
        - Still relevant with Shane's proposal?
        - API suggestions for [compound units](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-unit-format/issues/2)?
    1. [Closure i18n features](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WSvi865QADMs6vi6Z91hNauxxx_4cjyzdYPCNyJ_Xgc/edit#gid=0)
        1. Number parsing (Discuss)
        1. Compact decimal format (covered by Shane's proposal)
        1. Scientific format (covered by Shane's proposal)
        1. [IntervalFormat](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/188)
            - Should we add `.formatRange(date1, date2)` to `Intl.DateTimeFormat` or propose adding a new formatter (`Intl.DateIntervalFormat`)?
        1. Date time parsing (Discuss)
        1. Unicode BIDI algorithm (Discuss; not in Closure)
1. Future meetings
    1. Does the two-hour, once a month format still work well?
    1. Feedback about prioritization, running meeting, etc
    1. Is March 16th at 17:15 UTC a good next meeting time? (Note: TC39 is in London March 20-22)
        - Are we missing out on participation from Asia with these meeting times?
        - Standing request: Find a time which is not Friday evening in some time zones
