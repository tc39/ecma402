1. Bugs/PRs against ECMA-402
    1. Unicode Locale Identifier: Propose to change the text in [6.2 Language Tags](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-402/#sec-language-tags), [6.2.2 IsStructurallyValidLanguageTag](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-402/#sec-isstructurallyvalidlanguagetag), [6.2.3 CanonicalizeLanguageTag](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-402/#sec-canonicalizelanguagetag) and [DefaultLocale](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-402/#sec-defaultlocale) from referring to "BCP 47 language tags" to "UTS35 Locale Unicode Identifier" to align with what we agree in end of Nov. See https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/289
    2. Intl.NumberFormat: [Skip FractionDigits if we set SignificantDigits](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/306) also [PR307](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/307)
    3. [ResolveLocale drop Unicode extension keys without values](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/223) also see [PR302](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/302) and [test262/PR1995](https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/1995) - the "-u-kn" got dropped issue. Also [intl-locale/issues/65](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/issues/65)
    4. Double rounding: [#128](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/128). Web reality is that Intl.NumberFormat uses "short form" rounding, but Number.prototype.toPrecision use "long form" rounding. Shane prefers to keep web reality and encode it in the spec and test262.
