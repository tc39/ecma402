1. Bugs/PRs against ECMA-402
    1. Unicode Locale Identifier: Propose to change the text in [6.2 Language Tags](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-402/#sec-language-tags), [6.2.2 IsStructurallyValidLanguageTag](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-402/#sec-isstructurallyvalidlanguagetag), [6.2.3 CanonicalizeLanguageTag](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-402/#sec-canonicalizelanguagetag) and [DefaultLocale](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-402/#sec-defaultlocale) from referring to "BCP 47 language tags" to "UTS35 Locale Unicode Identifier" to align with what we agree in end of Nov. See https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/289
    2. Intl.NumberFormat: [Skip FractionDigits if we set SignificantDigits](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/306) also [PR307](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/307)
    3. Double rounding: [#128](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/128). Web reality is that Intl.NumberFormat uses "short form" rounding, but Number.prototype.toPrecision use "long form" rounding. Shane prefers to keep web reality and encode it in the spec and test262.
    4. locale returned by resolvedOptions()

ResolveLocale drop Unicode extension keys without values [#223](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/223) also see [PR302](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/302) and [test262/PR1995](https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/1995) - the "-u-kn" got dropped issue.
