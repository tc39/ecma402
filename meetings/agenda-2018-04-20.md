1. Administrative issues
    1. Anyone want to help out with cleaning up and publishing notes for this meeting and past meetings?

    1. Next steps on resolution on grandfathered tags from last meeting?
        - Are ECMA-402 changes needed, or is this only about Intl.Locale?
    1. [Intl.Locale issues](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/issues)
        - [Add Intl.Locale.prototype.baseName](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/issues/22)?

        - Is anyone interested in implementing? (Small amount of plumbing code)

        - Shane to implement?

    1. [NumberFormat changes](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/215), including (a) restructuring the spec, (b) minor changes to behavior, (c) support for measure units, and (d) support for scientific and compact notation.
        - Last meeting, settled on top-level settings, and maintaining `style`. Any further thoughts?
        - Status of [C API](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-13597) (necessary for 3 browsers)
        - Next steps on [proposal repository](https://github.com/sffc/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat)
    1. [formatRange/formatRangeToParts](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/188) (Felipe)
        - Last meeting, settled on the following. Any further thoughts?
            - formatRangeToParts returns a flat array, with a new attribute
            - formatRange/formatRangeToParts as methods on Intl.DateFormat, rather than a new class
        - Next steps
    1. [BigInt.prototype.toLocaleString](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/218#issuecomment-370789166)
