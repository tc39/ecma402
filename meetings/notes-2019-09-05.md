## Liaison Updates

### MessageFormat Working Group

- [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/message-format-wg)

RC: We're a bit delayed, but I finished this week the last 1:1 meeting.  Now I'm planning to send an invitation for a longer session with all the stakeholders, to set up a meeting to see each other on a more regular basis.

SC: How many 1:1 have you had?

RC: About 1 per week; in some cases we had additional meetings too.  We had great output.  The 1:1 meetings were an idea between me and Daniel.

## PR Status Updates

### Normative: Add calendar and numberingSystem options (#175)

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/175)
- Previously: FT decided to wait until the next two issues get addressed (#227, #351).  Because it could cause forward-behavior problems.
- Last month: Wait until Dan is back.
- [Test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/2331)

DE: I don't understand why 349 and 351 are marked as dependencies.

SC: I think FT had seen forward-behavior problems.

DE: Can SC sync with FT offline?

SC: Sure.  Otherwise do we have consensus for this PR?

LB: Yep

DE: Yep

SC: I'd like LB/RC/JW to fill in the 262, MDN, and SpiderMonkey links.

RC: Which formats get affected?

JW: It affects DateTime and Number format.

JW: SpiderMonkey bug on file, 

### Normative: Permit relatedYear and yearName in output (#351)

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/351)
- Previously: ECMA 402 has consensus on the PR, and the directly related PRs.
- Last month: We need TC39 approval.  Wait until Dan is back.
- [Test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/2332)

DE: Can we merge this once we have the tests?

SC: Yes.  How about MDN?

LB: Yes.  And I don't think MDN is a blocker but we need to track it.

### Normative: Allow calendar to determine choice of pattern (#349)

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/349)
- Previously: Consensus based on #351.
- Last month: Wait until Dan is back.
- [Test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/2333)

SC: Do we need 262/MDN?

DE: I don't think it makes sense to have MDN.  For 262, we could make a test if people think it's appropriate.

LB: If whoever is writing the tests finds it's not possible, let me know so I can proceed with merging the PR.

DE: Sounds good.

### Normative: Add fractionalSecondDigits option

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/347)
- Partial tests in https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/2194
- V8 behind flag --harmony_intl_dateformat_fractional_second_digits
- SpiderMonkey behind the flag (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568134 & https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1569927 )
- Previously: Consensus in ECMA-402. FT will push for Chrome 78. Romulo will work on MDN. Notes: not yet covered in Test262: format , formatToParts , formatRange and formatRangeToParts.
- Last month:
  - FT: I think Anba found some issues that might need to be addressed.  We need to change other spec to implement this thing.  It's more complicated than I originally thought.
  - RC: On MDN things are moving a bit slow.
  - VY: I can write some tests this afternoon.

SC: Is there an update on the tests or MDN?

RC: Not on MDN

ZB: I see we already landed this in 70.
	https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568134 & https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1569927 

JW: Yeah, we landed a fair bit of it.  It's behind options.  I recall pretty severe problems.

SC: So it sounds like the main issue here is the ICU bugs?  FB is going to start investigating them more in Q4.

JW: I think that's probably fair.

### Normative: Add dayPeriod option

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/346)
- Partial tests in https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/2194 and https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/2217
- V8 behind flag --harmony_intl_dateformat_day_period
- Previously: Consensus achieved. Still need MDN. FT will push for Chrome 78.
- Last month:
  - FT: Similar issue as above.
  - ZB: SpiderMonkey [has a patch](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1569103) blocked on ICU bugs.

SC: This one is also blocked on ICU?

ZB: Yes, that appears to be the case.

### Normative: Add quarter option

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/345)
- Partial tests in https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/2194
- V8 behind flag --harmony_intl_dateformat_quarter
- Previously: concerns raised over what this means for non-Gregorian calendars.
- Last month: FT deferred questions to the CLDR level.
- Notes: not yet covered in Test262: format , formatToParts , formatRange and formatRangeToParts.

SC: Question: convert this PR to a regular issue so that we don't have PRs that are open indefinitely?

LB: Sounds good.  I don't have problems having a PR open though.

SC: I'll convert this to an issue.

### Previous PRs

Do we have MDN and Test262 for these?

- https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/279
- https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/278
- https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/341
- https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/333

- Last month:
  - SC: If VY, LB, and RC can verify this offline, would be great.
  - VY: Sure
  - RC: Sure

RC: No update; I'm checking the issues.  I think some of them are missing though and should be reviewed.

LB: For #333 I think we have tests.  For #341 I think we can't have tests for implementation-defined parts.  We do have tests for #278 (comment from FT) and #279 (comment from Ms2ger).

LB: I heard feedback from JSConf Brazil that MDN for Intl is lacking in translations for pt-BR.  It would be great to get more engagement to help translate MDN to more languages.

DE: Yeah, and there's also a lot missing in Spanish.

RC: It's important to synchronize the evolution of the translations from English.

DE: Yeah, maybe focus on stable established APIs.

LB: I wonder if we can share more about presentations we give about Intl APIs.  I talked about democracy and how Intl supports sharing facts and information.  I think it would be nice to share more ideas with others in this group.

SC: I like that idea.  We should reserve some time at the next ECMA-402 meeting for this.

## Proposal Status Updates

### Intl.ListFormat (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/zbraniecki/proposal-intl-list-format)
- [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433306): likely to be reviewed/landed later this week
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.ListFormat?date=2019-07-10): Good.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ListFormat): Good.
- [MDN Bug](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-list-format/issues/37) Closed 
- Main blocker: bug with `type: 'disjunction'` in Spanish, [#45](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-list-format/issues/45)
- Previously: YM is working on the CLDR ticket. André Bargull (@anba) has a patch which is waiting for review for Firefox.  Low priority for Safari.
- Last month: YM: We decided to use transforms to solve the Spanish issue.  We are working on getting a list of all languages to see if there are similar issues, and also verifying that the data is right for all those languages.

JW: It seems ICU doesn't expose all of the functionality to implement the full feature surface.  That's one reason it's in limbo.

SC: Is there an ICU issue about this?  How was V8 able to implement it?

JW: I'll try to find an ICU link through the patches I reviewed.  https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-12863  Basically it’s lack of stable-C-API support (likely there’s C++ support that v8 is using).

YM: We're trying to test the current implementation to generate items for each language for both conjunction and disjunction, and then send it to the language experts to find additional issues.

SC: If the issue is only in Spanish, we can fix it with a code hack; otherwise we will do a more robust solution in CLDR.

### Intl.Locale (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/zbraniecki/proposal-intl-locale)
- [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433303)
- [Firefox Bug 2](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1522070)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.Locale?date=2019-07-10): Good.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Locale): Needs examples, work on going from Jahziel Villasana and Romulo.
- [MDN Bug]: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/issues/70 Closed 
- Previously: André Bargull (@anba) also has an implementation that is on the review queue for mozilla.
- Last month: Intl.Locale landed in SpiderMonkey!  The feature is enabled, but only if you flip a preference.

RC: The MDN is finished with basic examples.  Additional use cases could be added.

SC: Is there a bug tracking the additional use cases?

RC: I'm coordinating with JV directly on this.

SC: Is there any reason we wouldn't be able to go for Stage 4 in October?

DE: It looks good; I'm excited for this!

LB: I don't see the Firefox results in the tests yet.  Is there a plan to release it without a flag?

ZB: Once it reaches Stage 4, we will remove the flag.

JW: I think we have landed some stuff on Stage 3.  I don't remember why this isn't enabled right away.  It may be there are follow-ups?  Let me look back.

ZB: My understanding is Anba likes to land first behind a flag.

LB: Stage advancement usually requires two implementations without a flag.  People will ask this in the TC39 meeting.

ZB: We test our engine against Test262 with the flags enabled.

LB: I'm not objecting to advancing to Stage 4, but these might be points raised at TC39.

ZB: I think we should remove the flag as soon as possible.

DE: This meeting sounds good to me.

SC: I'll take the AI to put this on the agenda for TC39.

### Intl.RelativeTimeFormat (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-relative-time)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.RelativeTimeFormat?date=2019-07-10): Good.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RelativeTimeFormat): Good.
- Previously: formatToParts landed in nightly! ZB wanted signoff from MM before Stage 4; MM said "we can chat afterward"; LB said that shipping in nightly is fine; ZB said, let's aim for September Stage 4.

ZB: I did not hear back from MM.  I just feel it would be nice to know whether we add these APIs to Chrome and Firefox in short term or long term.

DE: Most of Apple's implementations have come from external contributors.  We should continue down this path.

ZB: I think it's even more important to have sign off from Apple on Intl.Locale.  But RelativeTimeFormat is an endpoint API, so I'm OK moving forward.

SC: I'll take the AI to put this on the agenda for TC39.

LB: You can see the results already in Test262.

### Intl.NumberFormat Unified API Proposal (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/sffc/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.NumberFormat-unified/intl402): Only 4.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NumberFormat): Does not contain examples for this proposal.
- [MDN Bug](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat/issues/50)
- [Test262 Bug](https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/2233)
- Last month: (Landed in SpiderMonkey)[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1566410] (not exposed). Anba also had some follow-up ICU issues. JV: I'll start taking a look at the issue and see what I can do.  I might have more limited bandwidth coming up in the school year.

RC: I'm taking care of prioritizing this MDN and also formatRange.

SC: Ms2ger landed the 262 PR, so we should be good on 262.

SC: Is this shipping in SpiderMonkey?

JW: The code is landed; there are the ICU issues that make the proposal still a bit unstable.

https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D38338

SC: Thanks; I'll look at that list offline.

### DateTimeFormat dateStyle & timeStyle (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/zbraniecki/proposal-ecma402-datetime-style)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.DateTimeFormat-datetimestyle?date=2019-07-10): 16 tests.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat): Options documented (Missing Browser Compat-data)
- [MDN Bug](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-datetime-style/issues/33)
- [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1557718)
- Previously: V8 ship with Chrome 76
- Last month: In SpiderMonkey (not exposed). JV: I'm working on the MDN docs with RC.  We have an issue to track.

RC: We think MDN is confusing because it doesn't say what version the feature is available in, since it's different than Intl.DateTimeFormat.

SC: Is this ready for Stage 4?

JW: Our implementation is not something you can cite yet for Stage 4.

DE: It would be good to make sure someone is assigned to turn the flag on so we can move this to Stage 4.

ZB: OK, JW is right, our code is in mozIntl, and we need to migrate this to SpiderMonkey internals.

JW: I'll look into it.

### Intl.DateFormat.prototype.formatRange (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/fabalbon/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange)
- [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1496584)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/browse/intl402/DateTimeFormat/prototype/formatRange): Good.
- [MDN](): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat/formatRange 
- [MDN Bug] https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange/issues/12
- Previously: V8 ship with Chrome 76. The tests are all in.  We are in good shape. Spidermonkey intends to implement, can’t commit to any timeline.
- Last month:  JV: We have an issue to track formatRange for me and RC. VY: Test262 is complete; I reviewed the PRs a while ago.

FB: Currently this is blocked by 4 issues that were filed against ICU.  My intent is to start working on the issues in the next 1-2 months.  It means though that it is released in the Spring release of ICU.

SC: The fixes could be patched in also.

FB: One of the changes is an API change which might be harder to patch.

### Intl.Segmenter (Stage 2)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter)
- Previously: extended discussion about RG's proposed changes. Additional deep dive meeting with ICU stakeholders.
- Last month: RG: My plan still remains to push for advancement at the next TC39 meeting.  Resolution of the open tickets will be coming in the next 2 weeks.

RG: I'm looking at the open issues today.  Still intending to have this ready for advancement in the next meeting.

### Intl.DisplayNames (Stage 2)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39-transfer/proposal-intl-displaynames)
- Last month: Discussions about issues 46 and 47.

#### [Values of code for type: "dayPeriod" #50](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-displaynames/issues/50)

- Last month: decided to split "dateTime" to type: “month”, “weekday”, “quarter”, “dayPeriod”.
- Question: for "dayPeriod" should we use integer or string?
- Last month's points in favor of numbers:
  - If we add "am" "pm", we are adding new string identifiers to the language.
  - It almost sounds like the issue with quarters.  We included quarters but not trimesters.  And we're using numbers for quarters.  So I think it makes sense to use numbers for day periods, 1 and 2. EA: It's not uniform to split a year into 4 parts.  And it's not necessarily uniform to split the day to 2 parts.  So the logic that follows from these non-universal splits should be for both.
  - You might have a user writing a for loop that starts at i=1, and write a loop to enumerate over day names, month names, etc.  am/pm should be the same.
  - It also makes sense that we are converting all of dateTime from strings to numbers.
- Last month's points in favor of strings:
  - We also have dateTimeField which has strings.  I think it makes more sense to use strings.  Either way, we have to code it into the table.
  - For the end user, I think "am" "pm" is easier to understand.


```javascript
new Intl.DisplayNames("en-US", {type: "weekday"}).of(1); // "monday"
```

ZB: "am"/"pm" is a very Anglo-centric way of expressing day periods.

DE: It seems like numbering could cause problems with compatibility with month and weekdays.

SC: Review #47 and #48 for the motivation.

DE: I'll review this more offline.  For adding string identifiers, the prior art is the names from ICU.  And it's weird that Undicember is number 13 when it could occur in the middle of the year.

SC: Let's table this discussion until next meeting, also when we hopefully have Frank and Eemeli.

#### [Address review feedback from litherum #40](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-displaynames/pull/40)

SC: I pinged litherum on the thread.

### Temporal (Stage 2)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal)
- Last month: Ms2ger has a preliminary PR ([#140](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/140))

SC: Let's sync in the Temporal meeting next week about this PR.

## Discussions

- [Board](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/projects/1#column-5001141)

### Segmenter: iterate segments or boundaries?

- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter/issues/80

(See issue thread for discussion.)

### Integrate resolvedOptions() with BCP-47 #68

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/68)

(Briefly revisited issue; committee will review offline)
