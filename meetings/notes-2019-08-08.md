## Liaison Updates

### MessageFormat Working Group

RC: We've had around 5 1:1 meetings with various stakeholders.  I'm preparing a report about the meetings.  I'm still missing a few meetings with some references that DE asked me for.  During these next days, I'll also propose a calendar for our biweekly meeting to start working on what we set on the first meeting: working on the data model, and start thinking about the transport layer as well, but mainly exchange ideas between stakeholders.

EA: I'm interested in joining that one.

RC: I'll send you a link if we can also have a 1:1 meeting as well.

SC: Also please join the mailing list.

## PR Status Updates

### Editorial: clarification how to calculate gregorian date and time values #348

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/348)
- [Rendered](https://spectranaut.github.io/ecma402/#sec-tolocaltime)

VY: Thanks everyone who gave feedback.  The problem is that toLocalTime is not well described in the original spec.  I wrote this PR to clarify that explicitly.  The one remaining question is, it's not clear how to hook into ECMA-262 because the calculation from UTC time value to local time value in ECMA-262… (explains the PR; see the "Rendered" link above)

RG: I'm pretty sure I have open PRs on 262 that edit that section.

VY: What are you modifying?

RG: It was touching stuff around LocalTZA.  Let me check.  [Here it is](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/1564).  It doesn't look like it has blocking changes for you.

VY: Thanks, I'll look at that next.

SC: What are the open questions?

VY: Is the prose in 2a ok?

FT: Is the daylight saving time considered in LocalTZA?

VY: Yes it is.

SC: Do we need to say that [[inDST]] is from the same source as LocalTZA?

VY: I'll look at that and RG's [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/1564/) and then merge.

### Normative: Add calendar and numberingSystem options (#175)

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/175)
- Previously: FT decided to wait until the next two issues get addressed (#227, #351).  Because it could cause forward-behavior problems.
- Last month: Wait until Dan is back.



### Normative: Permit relatedYear and yearName in output (#351)

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/351)
- Previously: ECMA 402 has consensus on the PR, and the directly related PRs.
- Last month: We need TC39 approval.  Wait until Dan is back.

No updates.  Still waiting for Dan.

### Normative: Allow calendar to determine choice of pattern (#349)

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/349)
- Previously: Consensus based on #351.
- Last month: Wait until Dan is back.

No updates.  Still waiting for Dan.

### Normative: Add fractionalSecondDigits option

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/347)
- Partial tests in https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/2194
- V8 behind flag --harmony_intl_dateformat_fractional_second_digits
- Last month: Consensus in ECMA-402. FT will push for Chrome 78. Romulo will work on MDN. Notes: not yet covered in Test262: format , formatToParts , formatRange and formatRangeToParts.

FT: I think Anba found some issues that might need to be addressed.  We need to change other spec to implement this thing.  It's more complicated than I originally thought.

RC: On MDN things are moving a bit slow.

LB: I'm also happy to help mentor anyone who's interested in this.  It should be short and quick.

VY: I can write some tests this afternoon.

### Normative: Add dayPeriod option

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/346)
- Partial tests in https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/2194 and https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/2217
- V8 behind flag --harmony_intl_dateformat_day_period
- Previously: Consensus achieved. Still need MDN.
- Last month: FT will push for Chrome 78.

FT: Similar issue as above.

ZB: SpiderMonkey [has a patch](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1569103) blocked on ICU bugs.

### Normative: Add quarter option

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/345)
- Partial tests in https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/2194
- V8 behind flag --harmony_intl_dateformat_quarter
- Previously: concerns raised over what this means for non-Gregorian calendars.
- Last month: FT deferred questions to the CLDR level.
- Notes: not yet covered in Test262: format , formatToParts , formatRange and formatRangeToParts.

No update.

### Previous PRs

Do we have MDN and Test262 for these?

- https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/279
- https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/278
- https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/341
- https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/333

SC: If VY, LB, and RC can verify this offline, would be great.

VY: Sure

RC: Sure

## Proposal Status Updates

### Intl.ListFormat (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/zbraniecki/proposal-intl-list-format)
- [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433306): likely to be reviewed/landed later this week
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.ListFormat?date=2019-07-10): Good.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ListFormat): Good.
- [MDN Bug](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-list-format/issues/37)
- Main blocker: bug with `type: 'disjunction'` in Spanish, [#45](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-list-format/issues/45)
- Last month: YM is working on the CLDR ticket. André Bargull (@anba) has a patch which is waiting for review for Firefox.  Low priority for Safari.

YM: We decided to use transforms to solve the Spanish issue.  We are working on getting a list of all languages to see if there are similar issues, and also verifying that the data is right for all those languages.  We found some bugs in Arabic and Japanese already.

FT: So the issue is not only in Spanish, but Spanish helped us verify that there was a context problem?

YM: Yeah, but in Arabic the rule itself is actually wrong.  And Japanese doesn't have data for "and".

### Intl.Locale (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/zbraniecki/proposal-intl-locale)
- [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433303)
- [Firefox Bug 2](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1522070)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.Locale?date=2019-07-10): Good.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Locale): Needs examples, work on going from Jahziel Villasana and Romulo.
- [MDN Bug]: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/issues/70
- Previously: André Bargull (@anba) also has an implementation that is on the review queue for mozilla.
- Last month: ZB says, We are about to land a major patch that moves us to use local identifiers (1522070). Will unblock landing of intl.Local.  Hopefully milestone 70, but maybe 71.  JW says, I might be able to finish reviewing those patches this week.

JW: Intl.Locale landed in SpiderMonkey!  There are some internal details, but the feature is shipped.  I think it's in the 70 release.

ZB: I don't think it's exposed.  I think we're waiting for Stage 4.  But it's implemented, and implementer feedback provided.

JV: MDN is actually done.  RC closed the issue 20 days ago.  So everything should be good on MDN.

FT: Do we need to prepare anything editorially for TC39?

SC: The TC39 process says, "A pull request has been sent to tc39/ecma262 with the integrated spec text".  AI: That's something the champion or the editor should work with offline.

FT: tc39/ecma402 for our context.

### Intl.RelativeTimeFormat (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-relative-time)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.RelativeTimeFormat?date=2019-07-10): Good.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RelativeTimeFormat): Good.
- Previously: Firefox needs to upgrade to ICU 64.  FT: It should land pretty soon in V8.  And it won't have a flag.
- Last month: ZB: formatToParts landed in nightly! ZB wanted signoff from MM before Stage 4; MM said "we can chat afterward"; LB said that shipping in nightly is fine; ZB said, let's aim for September Stage 4.

SC: Same action items as above.

### Intl.NumberFormat Unified API Proposal (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/sffc/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.NumberFormat-unified/intl402): Only 4.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NumberFormat): Does not contain examples for this proposal.
- [MDN Bug](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat/issues/50)
- [Test262 Bug](https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/2233)
- Last month: PRs to use camel case.

ZB: (Landed in SpiderMonkey)[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1566410] (not exposed)

SC: Anba also had some follow-up ICU issues.

SC: Ms2ger is working on the Test262 (see issue link above).

JV: I'll start taking a look at the issue and see what I can do.  I might have more limited bandwidth coming up in the school year.

#### [Issue 66](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat/issues/66)

FT: I personally think option 1 is better for the user.  It helps differentiate between exactly zero and not zero.

YM: Or maybe we could use the approximately sign.

SC: That sounds like a good idea but it's beyond the scope 

RG: My first reaction is a preference for Option 2.  Intuitively, the signDisplay field is relating to display, and is therefore associated in my mind with the output of the format.  So to preserve something that mattered only on the input side is surprising.

VY: I agree with RG.  I prefer 2.  I can't think of another case when you prefer +0 or -0.

RG: And if you care about that, you wouldn't say exceptZero as an option.  So it reads to me like, don't associate a sign with zero values, and option 1 does precisely that.

SC: You can get Option 1 behavior even if we implement Option 2.

```javascript
function formatOption1(num) {
  if (num === 0) {
    return num.toLocaleString(undefined, { signDisplay: "never" })
  } else {
    return num.toLocaleString(undefined, { signDisplay: "always" })
  }
}
```

FT: I don't have a strong opinion.

SC: I think this isn't a blocker for the proposal, but we should fix before Stage 4 since this is a normative spec change.

CC: Why is zero special?  If the input is a little less or more than one, you still get the sign on one.  So, I think Option 2 makes more sense, which also applies to other values as well.

Consensus: Option 2.

#### [Issue 60](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat/issues/60)

Everyone: What is a -NAN

JW: When you have a NAN with a sign bit set, a particular bit pattern.

FZ: Is there a mathematical meaning for it?

JW: No.

SC: My proposal is to treat NAN as numerically equal to zero.

EA: Would that enable -NAN to be written somewhere in formatted output?

SC: Only if an implementation dependant NAN has a sign bit set, but in terms of the spec, we could make sure it doesn’t have the -NAN case. The hope is that this is an ICU detail that doesn’t affect javascript.

FZ: Should NAN be NAN or -NAN (in SC solution in the issue).

SC: There is a 262 function that isNan we can use for the spec

EA: We should not introduce a new category of number to test262. We should not have a reference to -NAN.

SC: I agree. Can we move forward with treating NAN as 0

JW: Is there any locales where having a NAN pattern is needed.

SC: There is no local pattern for NAN. We have two patterns: pattern with a sign and a pattern without a sign. The pattern without a sign is the pattern we use for NAN.

JW: In principle maybe the patterns could be renamed to [[withSignPattern]]/[[withoutSignPattern]] or similar, but that’s just an editorial nit.

EA: Does it matter at all for plural rules?

SC: No 

Consensus: use the spec text proposed [here](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat/issues/60#issuecomment-513696546) with one change to use the isNaN function from 262.

### DateTimeFormat dateStyle & timeStyle (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/zbraniecki/proposal-ecma402-datetime-style)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.DateTimeFormat-datetimestyle?date=2019-07-10): 16 tests.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat): None 
- [MDN Bug](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-datetime-style/issues/33)
- [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1557718)
- Previously: V8 ship with Chrome 76

ZB: In SpiderMonkey (not exposed)

JV: I'm working on the MDN docs with RC.  We have an issue to track.

FT: We also have the issue with the glue pattern.

SC: We discussed that last month; check the minutes.

FB: The consensus last month was to update the spec to reflect ICU behavior.

FT: That should be a separate, standalone PR against 402, not against this proposal.

SC: Sounds reasonable.  I consider it a backlog editorial issue.

### Intl.DateFormat.prototype.formatRange (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/fabalbon/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange)
- [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1496584)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/browse/intl402/DateTimeFormat/prototype/formatRange): Good.
- [MDN](): None.
- [MDN Bug] https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange/issues/12
- Previously: V8 ship with Chrome 76. The tests are all in.  We are in good shape.
- Last month: Spidermonkey intends to implement, can’t commit to any timeline.

JV: We have an issue to track formatRange for me and RC.

VY: Test262 is complete; I reviewed the PRs a while ago.

#### [Throw TypeError for missing start- or end-dates?](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange/issues/15)

CC: TypeError makes more sense to me.

SC: We could say, TypeError is when the thing is missing, and RangeError is when the thing is present but not valid.

LB: I agree

CC: How about null?

FB: If the argument is missing, it's undefined.  If it's null, the argument is present.

FT: In the spec, ToNumber treats null as zero… but FB's section is before ToNumber happens.

FT: What happens if you pass undefined now?

FB: It formats the current date.  But for formatRange, we decided that we always want the users to provide the two dates.

FT: What happens when you call format with null?

SC: It treats it as zero, converting to a number.  So I think we should do the same for formatRange.

FB: Is everyone okay with TypeError for undefined?

Consensus: use TypeError for undefined.

#### [ICU blockers for spec-compliant implementation](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange/issues/14)

[ICU bug with dateStyle/timeStyle](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20710)

SC: If ICU has been giving us pushback on adding more dateStyle/timeStyle features, why do we have this proposal?

ZB: The motivation for dateStyle/timeStyle is: (1) depending on locale, the actual fields displayed might be different, and (2) on operating systems, it helps with overrides.

SC: That makes perfect sense.  We should go back to ICU and make a stronger case.

ZB: We implemented an ICU (“connector”)[https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/intl/locale/OSPreferences.cpp#228]

### Intl.Segmenter (Stage 2)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter)
- Previously: extended discussion about RG's proposed changes. Additional deep dive meeting with ICU stakeholders.

RG: My plan still remains to push for advancement at the next TC39 meeting.  Resolution of the open tickets will be coming in the next 2 weeks.

### Intl.DisplayNames (Stage 2)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39-transfer/proposal-intl-displaynames)
- Last month: resolved several issues.

FT: I had originally wanted to push for Stage 3 in Redmond, but decided to wait in order to resolve issue 46/47.

#### [Shorten codes for weekdays and month names?](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-displaynames/issues/47) / [Names of Months or Week days](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-displaynames/issues/46)

- Propose to split type: “dateTime” to type: “month”, “weekday”, “quarter”, “dayPeriod” and use number as code instead.

FT: The solution to both of these issues can be one change.  Instead of having "dateTime" as a type, we have four types.  For month, weekday, and quarter, we use number as code.  dayPeriod is unsure whether to do string "am" "pm" or a number.  For weekday, it's unclear whether to use 1 for Sunday or Monday.

RC: I agree with splitting to 4 types.

EA: I would find it confusing if some of the numbers were base 0 and others were base 1.  It would be easier to handle if they were all base 0 or base 1.

FT: It's not about base 0 or 1.  It's about, is the first day of the week Sunday or Monday or Saturday.

EA: On Date objects, months are 0-indexed but days are 1-indexed.

SC: For months, we should use 0 to mean January, consistent with Date, but I don't know what Temporal does.

FT: That's confusing in Japanese, for example, where the name for January literally is "1 month".

EA: And September is the seventh month.  I do not think it makes sense to always follow Date, because Date is weird. It would be better to be internally consistent between 0-based and 1-based.

LB: Everything I’ve seen with temporal and from experience, the goal is to fix things from the Date API, so it should be different when the Date API is not good. I’m opposed to 0-indexed month. RG confirmed Temporal is being 1-indexed in the chat. Same as moment.js, on purpose.

FT: I’ll look into it and make a PR.

RG: Temporal is 1-indexed.

SC: Yeah, Temporal is 1-indexed.  So we should move forward with that convention.

SC: For the days of the week, ISO 8601 defines Monday as 1, Tuesday as 2, …, Sunday as 7.

SC: Q1, Q2, …, is 1-indexed.  So that works.

SC: What about day period?

EA: Boolean?

SC: Are there calendars that use day periods other than AM/PM?

CC: There are things like, early morning, late morning.

FT: Those don't have a standard definition across the locale.  Some of the locales only have afternoon1, others afternoon1 and 2, and the mapping is also locale-dependent.  So it doesn't really make sense to expose this in the display name API.

CC: We should be careful about dayPeriod as the name.

FT: The name dayPeriod is already in ECMA-402, as formatToParts output of Intl.DateTimeFormat.

CC: I see, so we need to distinguish that from the CLDR definition.


SC: If we add "am" "pm", we are adding new string identifiers to the language.  That's probably OK?

EA: It almost sounds like the issue with quarters.  We included quarters but not trimesters.  And we're using numbers for quarters.  So I think it makes sense to use numbers for day periods, 1 and 2.

SC: I can see that.  Makes sense to me.

FT: I don't follow.

EA: It's not uniform to split a year into 4 parts.  And it's not necessarily uniform to split the day to 2 parts.  So the logic that follows from these non-universal splits should be for both.

SC: It also makes sense that we are converting all of dateTime from strings to numbers.

FT: We also have dateTimeFile which has strings.  I think it makes more sense to use strings.  Either way, we have to code it into the table.

RC: For the end user, I think "am" "pm" is easier to understand.

SC: You might have a user writing a for loop that starts at i=1, and write a loop to enumerate over day names, month names, etc.  am/pm should be the same.

FT: But region codes are also enumerable.  There's just a larger number of them.

EA: Why is there a difference between day period and year period (quarter)?

FT: Strings also allows us to extend dayPeriod in the future to include afternoon1, etc.

SC: If we were to add other day periods, that should be a new type.



### Temporal (Stage 2)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal)
- Last month: Ms2ger has a preliminary PR ([#140](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/140))

## Discussions

- [Board](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/projects/1#column-5001141)

### Casing Follow-Up ([Issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-displaynames/issues/32))

SC: I need to put together a doc explaining the reasoning behind the conclusion we drew, and share it with the relevant parties for review.
