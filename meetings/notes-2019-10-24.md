## Liaison Updates

### TC39: Topics from Shu-yu Guo (SYG)

SYG: I'm interested in spinning up more TGs within TC39 like Intl, to do things that matter subject matter expertise or accelerate proposals.  How do you all feel TG2 is working?  Would you like more decision-making power?  Would it help the work of TG2 to have fewer synchronization points with TC39?

SRL: We should make it more apparent that this meeting is TG2.

LEO: Yeah, I'm fine with adding more clarity.

FYT: Yeah, we made it official a few months ago.

SYG: I find this a success story of what we were able to spin off from Plenary and do more in parallel with plenary.

FYT: It helps for developing proposals in early stages, and getting more people involved at later stages.

LEO: Here is the official TG2 doc: https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/tc39-tg2.htm

LEO: To answer SYG's question, I believe we have enough decision-making power.  We have some back-and-forth with TG1, but that's not a problem where we struggle.  We have reasonable decision-making power.

SYG: Did you have to wait for TG1?

LEO: Yeah, the camel case discussion.

SYG: Maybe you could say, you have power until Stage 2.

FYT: We go to TC39 for stage advancement.  We try to address all the concerns before we go there.

LEO: I like how we basically report something early, because we might have someone who wants to participate.  We tell TC39 that we have this new proposal.

SYG: Yes, that's important, regardless of where stage advancement gets done.  The reporting back to plenary that you have been doing has been very valuable.

SRL: There are a number of topics that may be somewhat blurry between ECMA-402 and ECMA-262 involvement.  For example, unicode properties.  It could be something under 402 but that also has an impact under 262, like regex.  So not everything is compartmentalized into being 402-specific.

SYG: Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.

### MessageFormat Working Group

- [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/message-format-wg)
- Doodle link: https://doodle.com/poll/thy6633vf7yaz2ir

RCA: We've had about 1 meeting each week.  We are at 14 meetings now!  I want you all to join the presentation of meeting notes.  I'm hoping to make that first session in November.

## PR Status Updates

### Normative: Add calendar and numberingSystem options (#175)

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/175)
- Anba found problems; FYT is fixing them in V8.
- FYT flip the bit to ship it in Chrome m80. (with #351 and #349)

JSW: I started looking at how to implement this in SpiderMonkey but need to look deeper into exactly how to direct ICU to apply these options..

### Normative: Permit relatedYear and yearName in output (#351)

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/351)
- FYT wrote tests in https://github.com/tc39/test262/commit/79591ae6c8f13f5c558576ad58846d80f33d0f0e
- LEO wrote: "I'd like to defer this to @littledan so you can pick the best description for relatedYear and yearName in their respective table."
- FYT flip the bit to ship it in Chrome m80 (w/ #175 and #349)

LEO: I tried to resolve the conflict, but I would like to get that from Daniel, the author.

### Normative: Allow calendar to determine choice of pattern (#349)

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/349)
- Covered by above tests
- LEO wrote: "@littledan would you mind rebasing this one as well?"
- FYT flip the bit to ship it in Chrome m80. (with #351 and #175)

Action: DE to rebase the PRs.

### Normative: Add fractionalSecondDigits option

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/347)
- FYT addressed Anba's feedback
- SpiderMonkey shipped (in nightly builds)  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568134

FYT: I need to double-check with Anba if there are any other issues he has.

SFC: It looks like these are ICU behavior bugs, so you can still implement the PR.

FYT: We should fix these bugs before shipping.

RCA: Can we put this on MDN?

JSW: This is a nightly build; probably not ready for MDN.

SRL: On ICU-20738, it looks like Anba's assessment is right, and this is an ICU bug.  We could consider this a lack of data, but I think it's also an ICU bug.

### Normative: Add dayPeriod option

- [PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/346)
- Last month: Blocked by ICU
- SpiderMonkey patch awaiting for ICU patches - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1569103

SFC: I mentored Caio on ICU and when he gets back he can finish working on these bugs.

SFC: On CLDR-13184, could you force the hour field to be shown if dayPeriod is requested?

SRL: Yeah, we do that in some calendars.  If you specify year and month, you get the era also, because it doesn't make sense without era.

ZB: I would prefer not to do this if necessary.  The option bag allows people to create unreasonable results.  If you try to cover all cases where the selection of options makes no sense, you have to go on a witch hunt.  For example, `day: numeric, seconds: numeric` (shown below).  Trying to cover all scenarios to protect users is unnecessary.

```javascript
(new Date()).toLocaleString("en", {day: "numeric", second: "numeric"});
// Result: "24, 59" (Fx 72)
```

SRL: So CLDR-13184 should not block 402.  Anba should go back and clarify but it should not block 402.

### Previous PRs

## Proposal Status Updates

### Intl.ListFormat (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/zbraniecki/proposal-intl-list-format)
- [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433306): likely to be reviewed/landed later this week
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.ListFormat?date=2019-07-10): Good.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ListFormat): Good.
- [MDN Bug](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-list-format/issues/37) Closed
- Main blocker: bug with `type: 'disjunction'` in Spanish, [#45](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-list-format/issues/45)
- Last month: JSW: Blocked by https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-12863

ZB: ListFormat landed in SM behind a flag.  The C API doesn't cover all cases.

Action: Shane to review JSW's patch.

### Intl.Locale (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/zbraniecki/proposal-intl-locale)
- [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433303)
- [Firefox Bug 2](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1522070)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.Locale?date=2019-07-10): Good.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Locale) Live Examples - OK
- [MDN Bug]: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/issues/70 Closed
- Previously: André Bargull (@anba) also has an implementation that is on the review queue for mozilla.
- Last month: Intl.Locale landed in SpiderMonkey!  The feature is enabled, but only if you flip a preference.

 - RCA:  JVA Merged  live examples for MDN

ZB: I know Jeff had some issues with parts of the patch.  I'll try to find it.

JSW: [The issue](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433303#c45) was that the canonicalizeLanguageTag produces one sort of canonicalization, and the kind performed by the constructor is different.  The Local constructor will do preferred replacements in the unicode extension subtag, and the other is just whether it matches the grammar.  I think everyone should agree on one thing.  I think canonicalizeLanguageTag should do the replacements.

FYT: We brought this up in ICU-TC yesterday.  This is not tied to the Intl.Locale proposal.  This is tied to the 402 spec.  The spec has a merged PR referring to the canonicalization.  The issue is correct, but we have to deal with 402 itself.

JSW: I don't want to ship with the way it currently is.

FYT: The PR is already merged.  It says the canonicalization is based on UTS 35.  That has the alias mapping.  But current ICU doesn't implement that.

https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sec-canonicalizelanguagetag
“A conforming implementation shall take the steps specified in the “BCP 47 Language Tag to Unicode BCP 47 Locale Identifier” algorithm, from Unicode Technical Standard #35 LDML § 3.3.1 BCP 47 Language Tag Conversion.”
The published one -  https://ecma-international.org/ecma-402/#sec-canonicalizelanguagetag

FYT: To be clear, this issue is in 402 already.  This issue should not affect the status of Intl.Locale.

Action: Zibi to go through the open issues on the Intl.Locale repository

### Intl.RelativeTimeFormat (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-relative-time)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.RelativeTimeFormat?date=2019-07-10): Good.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RelativeTimeFormat): Good.

LHO: I have an open PR onto the proposal.  I'm wondering what is the process.

Action: Clarify who is champion on each proposal, and ask if they need help

LHO: I'm willing to help out here too.

### Intl.NumberFormat Unified API Proposal (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/sffc/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat)
- [Test262 Tests](https://test262.report/features/Intl.NumberFormat-unified/intl402): Only 4.

- [MDN Bug](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-datetime-style/issues/33)
- [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1557718)
- [SpiderMonkey](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/mozintl/mozIntl.jsm#830)
- Previously: V8 ship with Chrome 76. In SpiderMonkey (not exposed). JV: I'm working on the MDN docs with RC.  We have an issue to track.
- Last month: JWN: dateStyle/timeStyle that we mentioned last meeting also still on the list of "we should do the minor polishing needed to ship"

- RCA - JVA started working on Compat-data this week [MDN]

JSW: We are waiting on ICU issues being fixed.

### Intl.DateFormat.prototype.formatRange (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/fabalbon/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange)
- [Firefox Bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1496584)

- [MDN Bug] https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange/issues/12
- Previously: V8 ship with Chrome 76. The tests are all in.  We are in good shape. Spidermonkey intends to implement, can’t commit to any timeline. JV: We have an issue to track formatRange for me and RC. VY: Test262 is complete; I reviewed the PRs a while ago.
- Previously: FBN: Currently this is blocked by 4 issues that were filed against ICU.  My intent is to start working on the issues in the next 1-2 months.  It means though that it is released in the Spring release of ICU.
- Last month: RCA: Both Pages for formatRange and formatRangeToParts have basic documentation and waiting for 2 PR for interactive-examples to land. https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange/issues/12

- RCA - Interactive examples for  formatRange already landed, waiting for formatRangeToParts to be merged[MDN]

### Intl.DisplayNames (Stage 3)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39-transfer/proposal-intl-displaynames)
- Advanced to Stage 3 in TC39 Oct meeting
- Add “calendar” option to get name for “month”, “weekday”, “quarter” and “dayPeriod”

LEO: Working on the tests, planning to have them done before the next TG2 meeting.

FYT: After the TC39 October meeting, we added the calendar option.  We still need to address how to access the leap month.

LEO: We can have tests for most of the API even with these open issues.

### Intl.Segmenter (Stage 2)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter)
- Previously: extended discussion about RGN's proposed changes. Additional deep dive meeting with ICU stakeholders.
- Previously: RGN: My plan still remains to push for advancement at the next TC39 meeting.

### Temporal (Stage 2)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal)
- Preliminary spec text checked in; waiting for additional updates from Ms2ger

## Discussions

- [Board](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/projects/2)

### Unicode Conference Updates

- [ZB] Unicode Conference report
	- ICU panel - Feedback on ECMA402
	- Rust Intl WG formed - https://github.com/i18n-concept/rust-discuss

ZB: We got lots of praise for ECMA-402 from the Unicode Conference (well done!).

ZB: We formed the Rust Intl interest group.  It is aimed to coordinate efforts to coordinate Intl support in Rust.  We are encouraging the design of Rust APIs after ECMA-402.  It seems that ECMA-402 is a good baseline for any port of ICU.

SRL: Even broader, for any i18n implementation should look at ECMA-402.  I think it's good that ECMA-402 looks at what is actually needed.

LEO: Do we have videos of the panel and mentioned presentations?

### Potential problem with data loading #17

[Issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange/issues/17)

SRL: You could have cases where a certain operation expects a heavyweight operation on the backend.  You might not be able to operate until you know the content of what you are formatting.  I don't think this is something that can be solved by changing the number of final functions.

FYT: The data for format and formatRange have minimal common data.  So there's a lot of waste.  If we know in the constructor, it can make it more efficient.  We can save some space, like ⅔.

LEO: While I like and appreciate the concept of using a promisified API, I have concerns.  We cannot break things we have already shipped.

ZB: Could we say, some data is pre-loaded by default, and then in an option bag, you can specify more data to load.  But if you need data in a terminal method, then that gets loaded at that point.

SFC: It would be good to load all data in the constructor, because we want the terminal format method to not be async.

RCA: I was thinking something like :

```js
const fmt = new Intl.DateTimeFormat( … , {
  load : ['format', 'formatRange']
});
fmt.formatRange(start, end);
```

LEO: `await Intl.load();` then classical API follows up

ZB: (proposal):
```
let dtf = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(undefined, { data: [“range”] });
dtf.formatRange(); // works

let dtf = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(undefined);
dtf.formatRange(); // errors out with “DateTimeFormat has to be loaded with data “range”
```

RCA: As an end user, I'm used to passing arguments like this.

SFC: Maybe something more like,

```js
let dtf = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(undefined, { range: true });
dtf.format(x);  // singular
dtf.format(x, y);  // range
```

ZB: Having the same terminal method name with different arguments is confusing.  The user knows they will need range, and they can tell us that in the constructor.

SFC: A new constructor would also pass intent to the constuctor.

```js
let drf = new Intl.DateRangeFormat(...)
```

ZB: I'd like to think about what this would look like if we added new long-tail data sets.


### Indexing month names for leap month #55

[Issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-displaynames/issues/55)

SFC: For example:

```js
new Intl.DisplayNames(undefined, { type: "month" }).of(1, { leap: true })
```

FYT: I'll need to spend time looking into this.

CCN: A question is whether "leap" is the right way to specify this.

FYT: In Korean, etc., there are similar cases.  I need to investigate.

### UnicodeProperties (Stage +0.0)

- [Proposal](https://github.com/srl295/es-unicode-properties)
- WIP - actual content now

MCM: What is the use case?

SFC: We should clarify that.

FYT: The regular expression covers a lot of those.  So it's not clear whether this is useful functionality beyond regular expression.

[SRL: it's the inverse of regex]
