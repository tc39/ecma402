1. Bugs/PRs against ECMA-402
    1. Should locales be general BCP47, or [Unicode BCP47 Locale Identifiers](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/proposed.html#BCP_47_Conformance)? ([issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/issues/63)). Implications:
        1. After canonicalizing, no support for grandfathered tags; private use is always as an extension
        1. Adopt CLDR semantics for some things on top of IANA
        1. Still ban _
    1. [Normative: Improve handling of non-Gregorian calendars](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/227) 
        1. Has anyone implemented relatedYear? If so, let's land this patch; if not, split out calendar schema aspect and land separately.
    1. [Normative: Don't harden supportedLocalesOf Array](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/278)
        1. Seem like a good idea?
    1. [Normative: Specify order of table traversal](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/279)
        1. Clarification suggested by Sathya Gunasekaran, but really it's a normative change
2. Stage 3 APIs
    1. [Intl.Locale](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale)
        1. Issues
            1. Sorry for letting the issues pile up a bit here!
            1. [Using Unicode locale ID vs BCP 47 in our spec](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/issues/63), presumably covered above; implications for other issues and PRs:
                1. [Incorrect double validation for language tag in ApplyOptionsToTag](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/issues/52)
                1. [Changes for InsertUnicodeExtension](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/pull/62)
                1. [Fix two issues with grandfathered tags](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/pull/57)
            1. Easy fix: [Normative: Fix type check in CanonicalizeLocaleList](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale/pull/64)
    2. [Intl.RelativeTimeFormat](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-relative-time)
        1. Great to see ICU stuff coming, thanks Frank!
    3. [Intl.ListFormat](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-list-format)
        1. Any issues?
    4. [Intl.Segmenter](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter)
        1. Great to see Frank's work here in V8!
        1. [Normative: Include position in segment object](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter/pull/42)
        1. [Should "breakType" rename to "segmentType"](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter/issues/44)
3. Stage 2 proposals
    2. [Intl.NumberFormat Unified Feature Proposal](https://github.com/sffc/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat)
        1. What's needed to prepare for Stage 3 in November?
    3. [formatRange/formatRangeToParts](https://github.com/fabalbon/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange) (Felipe)
        1. Any updates?
4. Newer proposals
    1. [dateStyle/timeStyle](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-ecma402-datetime-style) (Stage 1)
        1. New specification revision. Propose for Stage 2 in TC39?
        1. Reflects decisions from the last meeting:
            1. Use CLDR-style schema explicitly
            1. Don't apply any settings from the OS
            1. Don't throw errors when invalid option combinations are used
    2. [DisplayNames](https://github.com/brawer/proposal-intl-displaynames)
        1. Next steps?
        2. [API shape issue](https://github.com/brawer/proposal-intl-displaynames/issues/4)
        3. [Other issues](https://github.com/brawer/proposal-intl-displaynames/issues)
    4. [navigator.ontimezonechange](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/3047) -- any interest?
5. Polyfills
    1. Evolve Globalize.js into an Intl polyfill? (Rafael Xaviers)
        1. We're following up by email; anything more to discuss?
6. Future meetings
    1. Any topics to discuss at the next meeting?
    2. Meeting November 26th, 9:30-12:30, America/Los_Angeles, in Google Mountain View (which lobby to meet at?)
